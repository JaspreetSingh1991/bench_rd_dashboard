# Bench/RD Dashboard - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive React-based dashboard application has been created to analyze Bench/RD data from Excel files. The application provides two views (Matrix and Details) and implements complex business logic to categorize records based on multiple criteria.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Excel File Integration
- **Automatic File Loading**: Electron-based solution to automatically load files from Documents folder
- **Manual File Upload**: Web-based file upload functionality
- **File Validation**: Checks for required sheet name (`RD_BENCH_Tracker`) and column structure
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for missing files, sheets, or data

### 2. Business Logic Implementation
The application implements 5 status types with complex business rules:

1. **Available - ML return constraint**
   - Condition: `Deployment Status = "Avail_BenchRD"` AND `"ML Case"` in any of Match 1/2/3 columns
   - Case-insensitive matching

2. **Blocked**
   - Condition: `Deployment Status = "Blocked SPE"`

3. **Client Blocked**
   - Condition: `Deployment Status = "Blocked Outside SPE"`

4. **Available - Location Constraint**
   - Condition: `Deployment Status = "Avail_BenchRD"` AND `Location Constraint = "Yes"`
   - Case-insensitive matching

5. **Available - High Bench Ageing**
   - Condition: `Deployment Status = "Avail_BenchRD"` AND `Aging > 90`

### 3. Data Visualization
- **Matrix View**: Comprehensive table showing all Bench/RD types, grades, and status counts
- **Details View**: Separate cards for Bench and RD with detailed breakdowns
- **Real-time Updates**: Counts update automatically when data is loaded

### 4. Cross-Platform Support
- **Web Application**: Standard React app with file upload
- **Desktop Application**: Electron-based with automatic file access
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (React)
- **Components**: Modular structure with reusable components
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI for modern, responsive design
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation

### Backend (Electron)
- **File System Access**: Direct access to local files
- **IPC Communication**: Secure communication between main and renderer processes
- **Excel Processing**: XLSX library for Excel file parsing

### Business Logic
- **Utility Functions**: Separated business logic into reusable functions
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation of Excel file structure
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Usage Instructions

### For Web Application
1. Run `npm start`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click "Upload Excel File" to select your Excel file
4. Or click "Load Sample Data" for demonstration

### For Desktop Application
1. Run `npm run electron-dev` for development
2. Or run `npm run electron-pack` for production build
3. Use "Auto Load from Documents" to automatically load the file
4. Or use "Select Excel File" to browse for files

## Excel File Requirements

### File Specifications
- **Name**: `Bench_RD Tracker_update.xlsx`
- **Location**: Documents folder (for auto-load)
- **Sheet**: `RD_BENCH_Tracker`

### Required Columns
- `Bench/RD`: Identifies Bench or RD
- `Grade`: Grade type (A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, B4)
- `Deployment Status`: Current deployment status
- `Match 1`, `Match 2`, `Match 3`: Match information
- `Location Constraint`: Location constraint (Yes/No)
- `Aging`: Aging in days (numeric)

## Business Rules Validation

The application correctly implements all specified business rules:

1. **ML Return Constraint**: ✅ Checks for "Avail_BenchRD" + "ML Case" in match columns
2. **Blocked**: ✅ Checks for "Blocked SPE" deployment status
3. **Client Blocked**: ✅ Checks for "Blocked Outside SPE" deployment status
4. **Location Constraint**: ✅ Checks for "Avail_BenchRD" + "Yes" in location constraint
5. **High Bench Ageing**: ✅ Checks for "Avail_BenchRD" + aging > 90 days

## Testing

The application includes:
- **Sample Data Generation**: Realistic test data for demonstration
- **Business Logic Tests**: Validation of counting logic
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios
- **Data Validation**: Excel file structure validation

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Data Export**: Export filtered data to Excel/CSV
2. **Charts/Graphs**: Visual representation of data
3. **Filtering**: Advanced filtering options
4. **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh when Excel file changes
5. **User Authentication**: Multi-user support
6. **Database Integration**: Store historical data

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- React 19.1.1
- Material-UI 7.3.1
- XLSX 0.18.5
- React Router DOM 7.8.2

### Development Dependencies
- Electron (for desktop app)

- Wait-on (for development)
- Electron-builder (for packaging)

## Conclusion

The Bench/RD Dashboard successfully implements all requested features:
- ✅ Automatic Excel file loading from Documents folder
- ✅ Support for specific sheet name (`RD_BENCH_Tracker`)
- ✅ Matrix view with Bench/RD identification
- ✅ Status count calculation for all 5 status types
